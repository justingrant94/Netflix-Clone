This is a React component named Login.  Here's a breakdown of what it does:

It imports necessary modules and components from react, styled-components, and other custom components.
It defines a functional component named Login.
Inside the component, it initializes state variables using the useState hook to manage form input values (email and password).
It defines a function handleLogIn which is invoked when the login button is clicked. This function attempts to authenticate the user using the signInWithEmailAndPassword function provided by Firebase.
It uses the onAuthStateChanged function from Firebase to check if a user is already logged in. If a user is logged in, it redirects them to the home page using the navigate function from react-router-dom.
It renders JSX elements including a background image, header, form inputs for email and password, and a login button.
The component is styled using CSS-in-JS with styled-components.
Overall, this component represents the UI for a login page in a React application, integrated with Firebase authentication.







I undertook the development of a Netflix-inspired app clone, which incorporated NextAuth for user authentication and Vercel for seamless deployment. This side project integrated an external API to source data, with a primary emphasis on optimising the user experience. The app's architecture included NextAuth to securely manage user sign-ins, and Vercel served as the hosting and deployment platform, Through this project, I harnessed a range of technical tools and practices to deliver a user-friendly streaming platform, all while maintaining a robust and scalable application infrastructure.
